Personalized Fashion Recommendation System

AIM: Recommendending suitable clothing similar to user closet

Prerequisite Skills: Programming language (python tools & libraries), Machine Learning, Deep Learning

Project Type: Research Paper

Objectives: Based on a user's closet, it can suggest the ideal clothing combinations for someone with no sense of style. As the algorithm is entirely dependent on the clothing items present in the user's closet, it could not always suggest the greatest potential outfit to wear for a certain occasion.It attempts to close this research gap by thoroughly examining the guiding ideas, the approaches taken, and the effectiveness of the most advanced fashion suggestion systems. 
It is our responsibility to create algorithms that automatically propose to customers clothes (such as a shirt paired with a skirt and a pair of high-heeled shoes) that match their individual fashion tastes.
